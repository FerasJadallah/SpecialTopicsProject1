Project Definitions:
•	DDMS (Decentralized Document Management System):
A web-based system designed to allow students and professors to upload, download, and manage documents in a decentralized manner. The platform integrates secure authentication, decentralized storage, and blockchain-based metadata management to provide a secure, transparent, and efficient document management solution.
•	Decentralization:
The practice of distributing the storage and control of data across multiple locations rather than relying on a single central entity or server. This ensures higher security, reliability, and resilience.
•	IPFS (InterPlanetary File System):
A peer-to-peer file storage protocol that allows users to store and share files in a decentralized way, providing redundancy and improving the security of document storage.
•	Ethereum Blockchain:
A decentralized ledger used to store and verify metadata about documents in the DDMS system, ensuring transparency and immutability.
